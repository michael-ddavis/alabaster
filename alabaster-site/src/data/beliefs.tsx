          At Alabaster Ministries, everything we believe flows from a single truth: Jesus is worthy.
          Our beliefs are not just statements on paper—they are the foundation of a life poured out in love,
          worship, and obedience to Him. We exist to Love Jesus Well, to reflect His heart, and to make Him known
          in all the earth.

          God is the Creator of all things and the Sovereign over everything that exists. He needs nothing and no one,
          for He has always been and will always be. He is holy—completely set apart and unlike anything or anyone He has made.
          Yet He is also our Father—good, loving, and faithful in all that He does. Everything He does is good,
          because goodness is His nature.

          Jesus is the second person of the Godhead—Yahweh Himself revealed in the flesh. All of Scripture points to Him
          and speaks of Him. He is fully God and fully man, the Lamb of God who takes away the sins of the world.
          He is the First and the Last, the Beginning and the End.

          The Holy Spirit is the very Spirit of the Godhead—Yahweh Himself. He is the Spirit of truth and the power of God.
          Sent by the Father, He is our Helper who reveals Jesus to us and makes His life and sacrifice real within us.
          The Spirit gives us boldness to live out the Christian life and brings conviction that Jesus is alive and is Lord.
          He is the down payment and seal of our salvation—the guarantee that we belong to God.

          The Bible is the infallible and unchanging Word of God. It reveals Jesus to us in written form and teaches,
          corrects, and guides us in truth. Through Scripture, we learn to hear God's voice and understand His nature.
          The Bible is the final authority on who God is, how He works, and how we are called to live.
          The Word of God is the bottom line in all things.

        <p>
          Salvation is a gift from God—freely given and never earned. There is nothing a person can do to deserve it.
          By grace through faith, those who receive this gift in repentance are made new; Jesus, by His Spirit,
          comes to live within them, sealing them as His own. True salvation is always accompanied by repentance
          and genuine faith, producing good works that reflect a changed life. It is more than a confession—it is a transformation.

          The Church is the body and the bride of Christ Jesus. We are His hands and His feet, His temple made of living stones,
          called to minister to Him and display His glory on the earth. The Church exists to proclaim the coming of the Kingdom of God
          and to invite all who will listen and believe to enter in.

          The Holy Spirit works in the life of every believer to bring transformation at salvation and continual sanctification
          throughout their life. He gives spiritual gifts—nine in total—and works through them whenever and however He chooses.
          The Spirit makes Jesus real to us, empowers us to live for Him, and guides us by His voice into all truth.
          We believe in the supernatural nature of His work and the ongoing power of His presence in the life of the believer.

        <p>
          Humanity was created for the glory and purposes of God. Our creation, our fall, our redemption, and our salvation
          were never accidents or reactions—the Sovereign Lord planned all of it for His glory. Through Adam and Eve,
          sin entered the world, separating us from God. But through Christ, God reconciled us to Himself,
          taking our sin and debt upon Himself. By His death and resurrection, we are restored to who we were always meant to be—
          a true reflection of His glory, unblemished by sin, for all who believe in His Christ.

        <p>
          Worship means to bow down. It is far more than music—it is a heart posture before God, beholding His beauty,
          His splendor, His majesty, and His glory. Worship can take many forms—through music, silence, obedience,
          and sacrifice, to name a few. It is one of the main pillars of Alabaster because worship is at the very heart of God—
          to be adored and loved for who He is. He is worthy of worship simply because of His nature.
          When you teach a person to see Him clearly, the natural response is a worshipful heart that produces
          a laid-down life that <em>Loves Jesus Well</em>, as our core expression declares.

          Jesus is returning soon. Though no one knows the exact moment, we believe the faithful must live ready for His return.
          When He comes in power and glory, all other things will fade away, and He will take His rightful place on the throne of David
          in Jerusalem, conquering all His enemies. In that day, our salvation will be fully revealed,
          and we will live with Him forever—with Him where He is.
